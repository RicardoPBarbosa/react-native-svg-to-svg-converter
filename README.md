# About the App
This app allows you to convert React Native SVG components into standard SVG format.

It provides a user-friendly interface where you can paste your React Native SVG code, and it will generate the equivalent SVG code for you. You can optimize the SVG output and/or format it for better readability.

You can then copy the converted SVG code to your clipboard or download the SVG file directly.
